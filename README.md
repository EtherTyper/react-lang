# react-lang
A React renderer to real programs!

Stuff in the `src` folder is being actively worked on. You can see my progress [here](./spec.md).

### Mr. Rosier: Yes, this is Eli Bradley's project. Please click on the username.

This is a project for my Computer Science class, so it would be best if you could hold your contributions until I submit what code I have, just to make it more convenient to trace the origin of the code. I also am having some organization issues because of all the dead code and different approaches I attempted to creating the application. However, feel free to tell me suggestions and what you intend to contribute later through GitHub Issues!
